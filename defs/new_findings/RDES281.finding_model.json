Grade I: The structure of the disc is homogeneous, with a bright hyperintense white signal intensity and a normal disc height. Grade II: The structure of the disc is inhomogeneous, with a hyperintense white signal. The distinction between nucleus and anulus is clear, and the disc height is normal, with or without horizontal gray bands. Grade III: The structure of the disc is inhomogeneous, with an intermediate gray signal intensity. The distinction between nucleus and anulus is unclear, and the disc height is normal or slightly decreased. Grade IV: The structure of the disc is inhomogeneous, with an hypointense dark gray signal intensity. The distinction between nucleus and anulus is lost, and the disc height is normal or moderately decreased. Grade V: The structure of the disc is inhomogeneous, with a hypointense black signal intensity. The distinction between nucleus and anulus is lost, and the disc space is collapsed.  ",
