# Open Imaging Finding Models Repository

This is a repository for representing Open Imaging Finding Models. Finding models are updatable data models defining open, standard semantic tags for imaging findings and their properties. Relationships with other ontologies can also be included.

We have an [index of the current definitions](index.md).

We have a [description of the schema for defining OIFMs](schema/finding_model_schema.md); you can also find [the schema itself](schema/finding_model.schema.json).
